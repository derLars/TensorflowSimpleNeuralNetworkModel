Date: 13/10/2017

# In short: 
This project provides a reusable neural network model written in python and Tensorflow.

# Environment:
Language: Python 3.6.2
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Hardware: Intel I7-7700HQ, 16GiB DDR4, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti

3# Dependencies:
Python3
Tensorflow
numpy
(cuda) ONLY for GPU support
(matplotlib) ONLY for the testing
(open-cv) ONLY for the testing

# Usage:
1. Import NeuralNetworkModel
2. Instantiate a model, provide the inputSize, the size of all hiddenLayers and the number of classes
3. Train the model by calling 'trainModel' with the trainingSet, trainingLabels, testingSet and testingLabels
4. Save the model, if you want.
5. Let the model predict by calling the function 'predict'

--> An applied usage of the model can be seen in the Mnist example, named ModelTestMnist.py <--

# Additional Info:

source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate

ONLY for GPU support:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64
